# Arabic Slug Schema Guard

[![Packagist Version](https://img.shields.io/packagist/v/mantekio/arabic-slug-schema-guard)](https://packagist.org/packages/mantekio/arabic-slug-schema-guard) [![License: GPL v2](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPLv2-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

A WordPress **must-use plugin** that stops core updates from silently truncating long Arabic (and other non-Latin) URLs.

> 📖 **Full write-up:** [The 200-byte trap: why WordPress core updates break Arabic URLs](https://www.mantek.io/insights/wordpress-arabic-slug-truncation)

## The problem

WordPress stores post and term slugs **percent-encoded** in `VARCHAR(200)` columns (`wp_posts.post_name`, `wp_terms.slug`). Each Arabic character costs about **six bytes** once URL-encoded, so a `VARCHAR(200)` column holds only ~33 Arabic characters — and Arabic publishers widen the columns to `VARCHAR(1024)`.

The trap: on every major core update, `dbDelta()` reconciles the live schema against WordPress's canonical schema and **shrinks `VARCHAR(1024)` back to `VARCHAR(200)`**. Unlike `TEXT`/`BLOB`, `VARCHAR` has no downsize protection, so the truncation is silent and **unrecoverable** — and your long-headline URLs start returning 404.

Widening the column alone isn't enough, either: WordPress hard-codes `200` in **three** independent places — storage, slug **generation** (`sanitize_title_with_dashes()`), and collision **de-duplication** (`_truncate_post_slug()`).

## What it does

- **Prevents the shrink** (Layer 1) — filters `dbdelta_create_queries` so dbDelta's *desired* schema already says `1024`; it never emits a destructive `CHANGE COLUMN`. Covers the admin DB-upgrade screen, background auto-updates, and `wp core update-db`.
- **Stops new slugs truncating** (Layer 2) — replaces `sanitize_title_with_dashes()` with a byte-for-byte copy that raises the generation cap. The copy **self-tests against core** on each update: it diffs the fork against core's live function on short inputs (where neither cap fires), so if core ever rewrites that function it alerts — and can fall back to core's generator — instead of drifting silently.
- **Verifies + alerts** (tripwire) — after every core update it checks the real column widths, logs and (optionally) emails on a revert, and exposes a `wp asg verify` CLI command for cron.

Layer 3 (collision de-dup) only fires on slug clashes and is left optional — see the write-up.

## Installation

This is a must-use plugin, so it loads before the upgrade routine runs and can't be deactivated by accident.

**Manual**
```bash
mkdir -p wp-content/mu-plugins
cp arabic-slug-schema-guard.php wp-content/mu-plugins/
```

**Composer**
```bash
composer require mantekio/arabic-slug-schema-guard
```

### One-time: widen the columns

The plugin *keeps* the columns wide; you still widen them once. On a small site:

```sql
ALTER TABLE wp_posts MODIFY post_name VARCHAR(1024) NOT NULL DEFAULT '';
ALTER TABLE wp_terms MODIFY slug      VARCHAR(1024) NOT NULL DEFAULT '';
```

On a large `wp_posts` (millions of rows) the `200 → 1024` change crosses InnoDB's VARCHAR length-byte boundary and forces a full table rebuild — use an online schema-change tool instead of a raw `ALTER`:

```bash
pt-online-schema-change \
  --alter "MODIFY post_name VARCHAR(1024) NOT NULL DEFAULT ''" \
  --execute D=wordpress,t=wp_posts
```

## Configuration

Define before the plugin loads (e.g. in `wp-config.php`), or edit the constants at the top of the file:

| Constant | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `ASG_COLUMN_LEN` | `1024` | Physical column width (bytes) |
| `ASG_SLUG_BYTES` | `1000` | Max generated slug length — under the column, leaving room for a `-2` collision suffix |
| `ASG_ALERT_EMAIL` | *(unset)* | If defined, the tripwire (and the Layer-2 self-test) email this address on a column revert or fork drift |
| `ASG_L2_FAILSAFE` | *(unset)* | If defined truthy, on Layer-2 drift fall back to core's generator (slugs cap at 200) until you re-sync the copy |

## Verifying

```bash
wp asg verify
```

Nightly cron — alert if either column ever reverts:

```bash
0 3 * * *  cd /var/www/site && wp asg verify | grep -q REVERTED \
           && wp asg verify | mail -s "WP slug schema reverted on $(hostname)" ops@example.com
```

## Important caveats

- The tripwire restores the **column definition**, never bytes already truncated. Treat any revert as an incident: restore from backup and check your 404 logs.
- **Never import a SQL dump taken *before* you widened the columns** — the old `CREATE TABLE` puts you back at 200. A dump of the *current* database is fine.

## How it works (and why `VARCHAR(1024)` is safe)

The full root-cause analysis — the `dbDelta` chain, why the fixed **191-character index prefix** means widening the column carries no index / InnoDB / utf8mb4 risk, and the production rollout for multi-million-row sites — is in the write-up:
